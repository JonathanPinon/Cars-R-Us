## Sales microservice

The Sales microservice manages creating, deleting, and recieving data instances created from the four models.The Sales microservice conatins 4 models: Customer, Salesperson, Sale, *AutomobileVO*. 

The *AutomobileVO* is a duplicate of our Inventory Automobile model, and only take in one field `vin`. We use polling to scout for data in our Inventory database, and populate our sales database with the same automobile vins.

Each model, except for the *AutomobileVO*, has two view functions one that handles the methods `GET` and `POST` and another that handles `DELETE`.
